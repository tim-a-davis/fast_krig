    main process sends messages to this queue.  This function reads the queue, and
    executes work with a worker object.  In this particular case, it is with a Grid object.

    The message should be in the following form:

        "method": The method on the worker to execute,
        "args": The arguments to the method,
        "kwargs": The keyword arguments to the method

    Args:
        worker (Object, optional): The worker object on which the methods are executed. Defaults to None.
        worker_queue (Queue, optional): The inlet multiprocessing queue where the worker reads the messages. Defaults to None.
        result_queue (Queue, optional): The outlet multiprocessing queue where the results are sent. Defaults to None.
        myname (str, optional): The name of the worker. Defaults to None.
